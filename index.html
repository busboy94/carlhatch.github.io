<div id="biography">
<p>
	Welcome, I'm Carl Hatch. This is my website. 
</p>
<p>
	I am a fourth-year graduating student at UCLA, majoring in English and minoring in Math. 
	My interests involve writing comedy, live performance, and show programming. 
	Additionally, I enjoy working with numbers, in proofs or practical application.
</p>
<p>
	I am working toward a position related to these interests 
	in entertainment, education, or marketing. 
</p>
<p> 
	I constructed this website from scratch, using HTML and CSS. It features a
	portfolio sampling my work, my resume, and my LinkedIn. Additionally, I have more personal 
	content so viewers of this site can get to know me better, such as original music, skate
	clips, and whatever else I feel people should know about me.
</p>
<p> 
	If any of the things on here interest you as an employer or person, 
	please do not hesitate to contact me. I look forward to getting to know and work with you.
</p> 
<p>
Thank you for visiting, and look for future updates!
