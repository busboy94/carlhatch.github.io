<h2>About</h2>

<div id="about">
<p> 
    In high school I wanted to be an engineer, and the things I did reflected this idea of my future. I ran cross-country
    with the other math-minded students, took the calculus courses I needed to take, and applied as a
    civil engineering major to the colleges I thought I was qualified for.
</p>
<p> 
    This path I envisioned soon ended, concurrent with the end of a cross-country season curbed by injury. And much like 
    one breathes hard at the end of a race, I found myself hyperventilating and emailing colleges, asking them to change my applied 
    major to be undeclared, the dive bar of the academic yet directionless. Fortunately, despite my mercurial tendencies, 
    my general achievements held some weight and I was lucky enough to be accepted to UCLA.
</p>
<p>
    After floudering for a bit, I took the first quarter of my second year off on an academic leave of absence, 
    and while at home performed at my first open mic, held at the Royal Cup Cafe in my hometown of Long Beach. 
    I then returned to school and found a home in UCLA's comedy scene doing stand-up, four quarters after I first enrolled. 
</p>
<p>
    The first show I performed in was at the school's student union, and I did three minutes, which have proven to be a very important
    three minutes in my life. While not my first time performing, that set marked the first time I performed my own
    original ideas, and the laughs I got then have given me confidence in all of my work.
</p>
<p> 
    Since this set, my time at UCLA has changed drastically. My involvement in the comedy scene has grown, and through it I've gotten
    to meet many wonderful people in the performing arts community, along with the chance to perform <a class="intextlink" href="portfolio.html"></a>comedy</a> 
    regularly. I've also grown as a person from my undeclared days, and I now know I want performance to be a part of my life forever. 
</p>
<p> 
    Apart from comedy, I am a writer and I enjoy reading. I successfully enrolled in two of the UCLA English Department's 
    exclusive creative writing workshops, during which I studied <a class="intextlink" href="portfolio.html">lyric poetry</a>. I even draw sometimes, usually 
    illustrating this written work. My interest in literature focuses on the 20th century, some of my favorite books being 
   <i>The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro</i>, <i>The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath</i>, and <i>The Sun Also Rises</i> by Ernest Hemingway. 
    Funnily enough,  I've even returned to math with a new outlook, and I will be receiving a math minor, my 
    favorite courses being Topology and Real Analysis.
</p>
<p>
    Otherwise, some hobbies I enjoy are street <a class="intextlink" href="portfolio.html">skateboarding</a> and calisthenics. I also sing and play guitar 
    under a project called <a class="intextlink" href="portfolio.html">First Rate Flies</a> and with a comedy duo called Concierge. With my friends, 
    I like to play board games, Minecraft, go on runs, travel, and backpack. 
</p>
<p>
   I am currently working on a new music album, along with an illustrated anthology of poems. Despite the Coronavirus pandemic, 
   I am also editing a pilot script, sketches, and forming new stand-up material for when audiences can assemble once again. I'm also trying
   to get outside and take walks around my neighborhood more, to appreciate my immediate surroundings. Damn you COVID-19.
</p>
<p>
    I have a brother Eric, my best friend, who attends Stanford Universtiy. I play music with him, and he teaches me 
    how to code. My parents, Darrell and Julie, are two important figures in my life, and I am grateful for their support.
